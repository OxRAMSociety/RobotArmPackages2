Step 1:
input: array of (x,y) coordinates of the corners of the chess-board pieces

We want to convert this into chess-board squares (e.g a2, c9, etc), i.e write a function which takes in the a given (x,y) coordinate and outputs the square it is on


Step 2:
integrate a chess-bot which takes in the data of the pieces on the board, and tells us the next move

Step 3:
Write a function which takes in a chess move and converts it into (START,END) where START is a 3D coordinate of where the robot arm should move to pick up the chess piece and END is where it should move the piece to
